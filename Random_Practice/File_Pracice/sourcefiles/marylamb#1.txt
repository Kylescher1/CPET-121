Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white
as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went. Mary went. Mary went. And everywhere that Mary
went, the lamb was sure to go.
It followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day. It followed her to
school one day, which was against the rule.
It made the children laugh and play, laugh and play, laugh and play. It made the children
laugh and play to see the lamb at school.
And so the teacher sent it out, sent it out, sent it out. And so the teacher sent it out, but
still it lingered near.
It stood and waited round about, round about, round about. It stood and waited round
about, till Mary did appear.
“Why does the lamb love Mary so, Mary so, Mary so? Why does the lamb love Mary
so?” the little children cry.
